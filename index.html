        <h1>WILL YOU LOVE ME TOO???🥹🥹🥹</h1>
        <p class="message">
            You know nothing,
            And I have something
            To talk, to express, to share,
            Will you listen to me?

            I’m dying for you,
            And you have no time for me.

            I care for you,
            Don’t want to share you;
            I dare you,
            There is no other pair for you.

            I am scared,
            You’re utmost cared.

            You’re a father’s princess,
            I’ll make you a queen;
            Can I be your king?
            Cause I desire no prince.

            You’re a symbol of Innocence,
            I love your Kindness,
            I feel your Sweetness,
            And enjoy your Childishness.
 
            You’re a symbol,
            Of Love, of Peace, of Harmony,
            Your character is Pure,
            And Honest, yet Simple;
            Indeed, You bring Prosperity,
            And I want to preserve your all virtues.

            I thrive, to fulfill all your dreams,
            In my heart, there are screams;
            During winter, on your face,
            I want to put on creams.

            I want to make your hair,
            That’s how I care;
            Cause there is no perfect pair,
            And yes, I can’t share.

            I prefer dying,
            When you trying
            To be flying,
            Far away from being mine.

You’re innocent,
And act foolishly;
I won’t force over,
Cause I’m not Bruce Lee;
Will you accept me?

You’re my Inspiration,
You’re my Motivation,
You’re my Imagination,
You’re my Destination,
And you’re my Realisation.

My day starts with you,
And ends at you;
When you come to my dreams,
Such an awesome day it is.

I try,
Not to cry,
When emotions are dry,
There is no other way than try,
To love, to evolve and to make you smile;
Will you be mine?

Yes, I can’t tell you,
What I feel for you,
Yet I desire you;
I don’t know how,
To tell you.

I love you,
Will never touch you;
Yes, I desire you,
Yet no lust on you,
Will you love me too?
